# Tweet Analyzer
A (series of) Jupyter notebooks for analyzing tweets

In the `notebooks` folder, be sure to create a JSON file called `credentials.json` with your Twitter API credentials in the following format:

```json
{
  "consumer_key": "<key>",
  "consumer_secret": "<secret>",
  "access_token": "<token>",
  "access_token_secret": "<secret>"
}
```
